        <h2>Hi, I'm Hyreen Alice!</h2>
        <p>I am an experienced OnBase Developer with over 8 years of expertise in Workflow/WorkView, Unity API, and automation API, combined with a strong background as a Database Administrator. I specialize in SQL Server administration, high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) solutions, database performance optimization, and troubleshooting. Iâ€™ve developed and deployed OnBase solutions at Grand Valley State University, improving operational efficiency by automating critical university processes. My work also involves advanced data analysis using Power BI and NLP techniques for healthcare solutions at organizations like the Grand Rapids African American Health Institute and the African Collaborative Network. With a passion for technology, I continuously seek to leverage my skills to improve systems and support business goals.</p>
